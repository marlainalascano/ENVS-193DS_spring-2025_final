# ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final
Final for 193DS Spring 2025

## General info
In Problem 1, I showed my ability to execute research writing. We used an example from agricultural runoff in the San Joaquin River Delta and saw how that influences total nitrogen load (measured in kilograms per year, kg year-1). 

In Problem 2, a sea surface temperature example was run to show my ability to clean, summarize, and visualize data. We used data from the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER on sea surface temperature in the Santa Barbara Channel.

In Problem 3, the project shows the relationship between distance to the edge of a forest and the occupancy of a nest box by the Swift Parrot species. A generalized linear modeling tactic was used to find out how the edge closeness affects nesting probability and using an AICc comparison, the best model was selected, and visuals were created. The goal of this project was to understand how the forest edge can affect the Swift Parrot's preferences, which could be insightful data when making conservation or forest management changes. 

In Problem 4, I compared my visualizations from an older homework to a newer homework and analyzed how I actively used feedback to make better visualizations. 

## Data and File Info
For Problem 2 I used the data set from Santa Barbara Coastal LTER on sea surface temperature in the Santa Barbara Channel.

For Problem 3 I used data from the technical report "Do nest boxes breed the target species or its competitors? A case study of critically endangered bird."

All code is found in file titled "code"
